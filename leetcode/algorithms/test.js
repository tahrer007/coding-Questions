/*Here are the optimizations I made:

I defined constants for values that are used multiple times throughout the function (e.g. the total number of minutes and hours in a day, the degrees moved by the hour hand and minute hand per hour and minute, respectively).

I added input validation to ensure that the hour and minutes values are within the expected range (e.g. between 0 and 24 for the hour in a 24-hour format clock).

I simplified the calculation of the hour and minute angles using the predefined constants for degrees per hour and minute.

I adjusted the calculation of the hour hand angle to take into account the number of parts in a day (which is 24 for a 25-hour clock).

I simplified the calculation of the short hand location by dividing the hour in minutes and the minutes by the number of parts in a day.

I simplified the calculation of the acute angle by taking the absolute difference between the short hand angle and the minute angle and ensuring that the angle is acute by checking if it is greater than 180 degrees.

Overall, these optimizations should improve the performance and readability of the code while maintaining the same functionality as the original function.
